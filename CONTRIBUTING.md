# How to contribute

Helping out isn't just writing code, it also includes submitting issues and helping confirm issues. 

## Submitting Issues

Requests for new features and bug reports keep the project moving forward.

### Before you submit an issue

- Ensure you are running the latest version of the SDK.
- **Search** the [issue list](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/clc-net-sdk/issues) (including closed issues) to make sure it hasn't already been reported.

### Submitting a good issue

- Give the issue a short, clear title that describes the bug or feature request
- Include what version of NUnit you are using
- Tell us how you are running your tests including command line arguments for the console runner
- Include steps to reproduce the issue
- If possible, include a short code example that reproduces the issue
- Use [markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as appropriate to make the issue and code more readable.

## Confirming Issues

Before we work on issues, we must confirm them and be able to reproduce them. Confirming issues takes up a great deal of the team's time, so making that job easier is **really appreciated**.

Issues that need confirmation will have the **confirm** label or be unlabeled and have **no milestone**. You can help us to confirm issues by;

- Add steps to reproduce the issue
- Create unit tests to demonstrate the issue
- Test issues and provide feedback

## Fixing Bugs and Adding Features 

We love pull requests, but would prefer that new contributors start with smaller issues and let us know before you contribute to prevent duplication of work.

It is also a good idea to add a comment to an issue that you are working on to let everyone know. If you stop working on it, also please let us know.
